# Unit-14-LB1-Chips-and-Salas
Instructions:


Write a program that lets a maker of chips and salsa keep track of their sales for ﬁve different types of salsa they produce: mild, medium, sweet, hot, and zesty. It should use two parallel ﬁve-element arrays: an array of strings that holds the ﬁve salsa names and an array of integers that holds the number of jars sold during the past month for each salsa type. The salsa names should be stored using an initialization list at the time the name array is created. The program should prompt the user to enter the number of jars sold for each type. Once this sales data has been entered, the program should produce a report that displays sales for each salsa type, total sales, and the names of the highest selling and lowest selling products.
